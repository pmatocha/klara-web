In my work, I support clients facing challenging life situations, recurring patterns of behaviour, as well as everyday worries. I am not the expert of your story, but I can be a guide who helps you find direction. I primarily offer long-term therapy, which enables deeper self-understanding, personal growth, and insight into your inner experience. I also provide shorter-term counselling intended mainly for orientation in a current situation and finding solutions. Being heard can often help uncover answers to questions we are not yet able to answer on our own."
